                <p>BYU Cougars Rafting Tech exists to combine the spirit of adventure with the power
                    of
                    innovation. Our
                    purpose is to create reliable, cutting-edge rafting technology that empowers
                    people
                    to explore
                    rivers with confidence, safety, and respect for nature. Our mission is to design
                    and
                    deliver
                    high-quality solutions driven by teamwork, integrity, and continuous learning,
                    while
                    honoring a
                    culture of excellence and service. We believe in courage on the water,
                    discipline in
                    our craft, and
                    unity in our community—those are the values that guide every decision we make.
                    Our
                    creed is simple:
                    build with purpose, lead with integrity, and innovate for the greater good. Our
                    motto says it all:
                    “Innovation that Carries You Further.”</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>BYU Cougars Rafting Tech was founded by a group of BYU students and alumni who
                shared two
                passions: whitewater rafting and technology-driven problem solving. What began as a
                small university
                project focused on improving rafting safety equipment quickly evolved into a
                dedicated venture as
                early prototypes proved their value on real rivers. Through collaboration, rigorous
                testing, and a
                commitment to excellence, the company grew from a campus-based idea into a trusted
                name in rafting
                technology. Today, BYU Cougars Rafting Tech continues to build on its academic
                roots, blending
                innovation, adventure, and integrity to support rafters and guides around the world.
